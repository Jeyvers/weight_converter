This weight converter application initially converted pounds to grams, kilograms and ounces only. 
I learnt and implemented the codes by following Traversy's video (A simple weight converter app).
After the video, he gave an assignment: Turn the application into a multi converter, i.e from grams to kilograms, ounces and pounds, and vice versa in all ramifications. 
Spent the whole day trying to accomplish that but I couldn't. 


I finally did the assignment!!! I'm so happy. 
I tried many times, a compilation of all my trials are shown below the active codes (as comments).
If you're reading this and you know a simpler/easier way I could have achieved this, please don't hesitate to teach me. Thank you!
